**If you are familiar with docker, you can directly download the images from [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/ryuou02)**

## Note - 
1. **Get The Credit Card!** is made such that each user has the feel of having an independant instance, even though all players have access to the same instance.
2. In every challenge's directory, if there is a folder saying "handout", it means that you would have been given those files during the duration of the CTF. In case you don't see such a file, you would only be given the link to the challenge after it's hosted.
